Booking screen: Go to http://localhost:3000/book to see the booking form.

Test Real-time Chat:

Open the Chat Screen in two separate browser tabs by visiting http://localhost:3000/chat.
Try sending a message in one tab, and you should see the message appear in the other tab in real-time (thanks to Socket.io).
